//Cycle sort is an in-place sorting Algorithm, unstable sorting algorithm, and a
//comparison sort that is theoretically optimal in terms of the total number of writes
//to the original array.
//
//It is optimal in terms of the number of memory writes. It minimizes the number of
//memory writes to sort (Each value is either written zero times if itâ€™s already in its
//correct position or written one time to its correct position.)
//
//It is based on the idea that the array to be sorted can be divided into cycles.
//Cycles can be visualized as a graph. We have n nodes and an edge directed from node i
//to node j if the element at i-th index must be present at j-th index in the sorted array.
